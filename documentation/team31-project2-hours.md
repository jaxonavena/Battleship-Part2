Set up our forked repo and initialized the AI class after doing a couple playthroughs of the original team's design. It took 2 hours because I'm dumb.
```

9/23 1 hour
```
Worked on getting input for the AI opponent difficulty and actually wiring up the initialization of the AI opponent. WIP.
```

9/25 1.5 hour
```
Began implementing AI functionality -- having it take turns and whatnot.
Hopped on a call with Pete to see if I could explain and hand off a bug to him to help fix.
```

9/26 2 hours

Met with Pete and Ach online and planned a course of action to take to get around a bug we couldn't figure out. This jumpstarted our progress and now we're back on track. Everything is working with the AI opponent's initialization, progress is currently at the point getAIShot() gets called, but needs to be filled out. The plan is to do difficulties 1 and 3 before 2 due to complexity.

Went over Pete's additions and made some changes to fix the bugs. Difficulty 1 and 3 are now functioning for the AI.

9/28 3 hours

Got level 2 difficulty working for AI. Pete had left some code that was close, but not functioning that I changed to the current state.

Pulled up to the fishbowl to help with the special attack.

Fixed a bug where you could only make one move. Worked on the special attack where 3 random attacks are made. Jaxon helped me out a ton with this.
